In the second transform message component we should add   new  sort function called countriesNumber 
This function  should accept a number as a parameter(this parameter should be our "totalNumber" queryParameter that we stored previous into the variable called "totalNumberVar")  and can retrieve first n records (e.g., providing number `15` I should receive 15 first records from API). 
If "totalNumber" queryParameter=zero(0)  - no limatation is perform and give payload as is.
==============================================================
Certainly! The take function in DataWeave can be used to retrieve the first n elements of an array. Here's how you can implement the countriesNumber function:
%dw 2.0
output application/json

fun countriesNumber(countries, totalNumber) =
    if (totalNumber > 0)
        countries take totalNumber
    else 
        countries

---

countriesNumber(payload, vars.totalNumberVar)
